# Heart-Disease-Prediction
A majority of people now-a-days are dying because of some heart disease. Such problems do not develop overnight, instead takes years to reach some noticeable symptoms. It is necessary for everyone to be precautious especially of they have a family history of ailments related to heart. 
In this project, I have tried to develop a model with an accuracy of 79% that could determine whether a person is developing any symptoms indicating a heart disease based on certain information about the him/her. 
This project aims to predict the possibility of a person suffering with some heart disease based on the information about their heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar level, capillary width, number of colored blood vessels, age, and gender.
Logistic Regression and KNN have been implemented to facilitate prediction.
